# LeetCode Problem: Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

[Problem Link: Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)

## Problem Description

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the *decimal value* of the number in the linked list.

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,0,1] 
Output: 5 
Explanation: (101) in binary is 5 in decimal.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: head = [0] 
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed `30`.
- Each node's value is either `0` or `1`.
