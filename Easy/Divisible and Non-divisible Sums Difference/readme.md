## Description

This repository contains a solution to the "Divisible and Non-Divisible Sums Difference" problem from LeetCode.

### Task

You are given an array `arr` of integers and an integer `x`. You need to calculate the difference between the sum of elements divisible by `x` and the sum of elements not divisible by `x`.

### Example

For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `x = 2`, the sums would be:
- Sum of elements divisible by 2: 2 + 4 = 6
- Sum of elements not divisible by 2: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

The difference would be: `6 - 9 = -3`

### Input

- `arr`: A list of integers.
- `x`: An integer.

### Output

- An integer representing the difference between the sum of elements divisible by `x` and the sum of elements not divisible by `x`.
