# Intuition
The problem involves incrementing or decrementing a variable `ans` based on a list of operations provided in the form of strings. Each operation either increments or decrements the variable, depending on whether it contains '++' or '--'. The goal is to determine the final value of the variable after performing all operations.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0.
2. Iterate over each string in the `operations` vector.
3. Check the second character of each operation (`operations[i][1]`), which will either be `+` or `-`.
4. If it's `+`, increment `ans`.
5. If it's `-`, decrement `ans`.
6. Return the final value of `ans` after processing all operations.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  The time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the `operations` vector. This is because we iterate through the list once, and each operation (checking the second character) takes constant time O(1).

- Space complexity:  
  The space complexity is O(1), since we're only using a few extra variables (like `ans`) and not storing any additional data proportional to the input size.
