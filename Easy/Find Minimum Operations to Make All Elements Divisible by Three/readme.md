# Intuition
The goal of the problem is to make all elements in the array divisible by 3. To achieve this, we count how many elements in the array are not divisible by 3 and compute the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements divisible.

# Approach
1. Iterate through the array `nums`.
2. For each element, check if it is divisible by 3.
3. If the element is not divisible by 3, increment the operation count (`ans`).
4. Return the final count of operations required.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. We are iterating through each element once.
  
- Space complexity: O(1), as no extra space is used except for the integer `ans` that stores the number of operations.
