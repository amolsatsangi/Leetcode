# Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

**Problem Link:** [Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-corresponding-node-of-a-binary-tree-in-a-clone-of-that-tree/)

## Intuition
To find the corresponding node in the cloned tree, traverse the cloned tree and compare each node's value with the target node's value. When a match is found, we know that node corresponds to the target in the cloned structure.

## Approach
We perform a recursive traversal on the cloned tree, checking if the current node's value matches the target node's value:
1. If the current node is `null`, we return `null`.
2. If the current node's value matches the target node's value, we set the result as this node.
3. We recursively search the left and right children of the current node to continue looking for the target node.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as we may need to traverse the entire tree.
- **Space complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursive stack.
