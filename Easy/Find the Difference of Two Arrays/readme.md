# LeetCode Problem - Find the Difference of Two Arrays

**Link to the problem:** [Find the Difference of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays/description/)

## Intuition
To solve this problem, the key idea is to identify the unique elements in `nums1` that are not in `nums2` and vice versa. Using hash maps allows efficient lookups to determine if an element is unique to one of the arrays.

## Approach
1. Use a hash map to store the elements of the first array (`nums1`).
2. Traverse through the second array (`nums2`) and collect elements not found in the hash map of `nums1`.
3. Similarly, use another hash map to store the elements of `nums2` and collect the elements from `nums1` that are not found in this hash map.
4. Return the results as two separate lists: one for the unique elements in `nums1` and another for the unique elements in `nums2`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the size of `nums1` and `m` is the size of `nums2`. This accounts for the traversal of both arrays and the efficient hash map operations.
- **Space complexity:** O(n + m), due to the hash maps used to store elements of `nums1` and `nums2`.
