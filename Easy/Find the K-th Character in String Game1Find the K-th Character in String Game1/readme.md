### Problem Link: [Find the K-th Character in String Game I](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-417/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/)

## Problem Description:

You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`. In one move, you can choose any character in the string and append it to the end of the string. Your task is to determine the k-th character in the resulting string after any number of moves.

Write a function `find_kth_character(s, k)` that takes the string `s` and the integer `k` as inputs and returns the k-th character in the resulting string.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
s = "abc", k = 5
**Output:**
b

### Example 2:

**Input:**
s = "xyz", k = 4
**Output:**
x

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
