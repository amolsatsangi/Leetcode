# LeetCode Problem - Is Subsequence

**Link to the problem:** [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc" 
Output: true
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc" 
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
