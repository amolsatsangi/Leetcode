# LeetCode Problem - Sign of the Product of an Array

**Link to the problem:** [Sign of the Product of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=programming-skills)

## Intuition
The problem requires determining the sign of the product of all elements in the array. Instead of computing the actual product, we only need to track whether it will be positive, negative, or zero.  

## Approach
- Iterate through the array while checking for zero values. If a zero is found, return `0` immediately.  
- Count the number of negative numbers. If the count is even, the product is positive; otherwise, it is negative.  

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(n), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array, since we iterate through the array once.  
- **Space complexity:** O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.
