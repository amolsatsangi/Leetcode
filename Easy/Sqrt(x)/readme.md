[Link to the Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/solutions/5861118/efficient-c-solution-olog-n-100-performance/)

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4 
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we need to return the integer part, the answer is 2.
```

### Constraints:

- 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
