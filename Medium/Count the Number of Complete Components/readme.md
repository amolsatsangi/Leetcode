# Count the Number of Complete Components

## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the number of "complete components" in an undirected graph, where a complete component is a connected component in which every node is connected to every other node. Looking at the characteristics of a complete graph, in a complete graph with n nodes, each node should have exactly n-1 edges (connecting to all other nodes). This observation is key to my solution.

## Approach
1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph from the given edges.
2. Use BFS to identify all connected components in the graph.
3. For each connected component, check if it's a complete component by verifying that each node in the component has exactly (component size - 1) neighbors.
4. Count the number of components that satisfy this condition.

The key insight is that in a complete component of size n, each node must have exactly n-1 edges connecting to all other nodes in that component. This is checked by comparing each node's adjacency list size with the total number of nodes in the component minus one.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: **O(V + E)**
  - Building the adjacency list takes O(E) time
  - BFS traversal takes O(V + E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
  - Checking if each component is complete takes O(V) time
  
- Space complexity: **O(V + E)**
  - The adjacency list requires O(V + E) space
  - The visited array takes O(V) space
  - The queue for BFS takes O(V) space in the worst case
