# Neighboring Bitwise XOR

**Link to the problem:** [Neighboring Bitwise XOR](https://leetcode.com/problems/neighboring-bitwise-xor/description/)

## Intuition
The problem can be simplified by observing that the XOR of all elements in the `derived` array determines whether a valid original array exists. If the XOR is zero, the array can form a valid sequence.

## Approach
1. Traverse the `derived` array and compute the XOR of all its elements.
2. If the XOR of all elements equals zero, return `true`, indicating that a valid original array exists. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** \( O(n) \)  
  The solution involves iterating through the `derived` array once, where \( n \) is the size of the array.

- **Space complexity:** \( O(1) \)  
  No additional data structures are used, and the solution operates with constant extra space.
